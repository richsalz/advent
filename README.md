This is a collection of my work to solve the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) problems.

I decided to handicap myself:
- Using it to learn Rust (I'm a novice)
- Using VSCode not my usual
- Using a PC, which I haven't used for development in decades

I'll probably stop working on this before finishing.
